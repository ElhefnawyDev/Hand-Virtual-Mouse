# Hand Virtual Mouse "Inspired By Vision PRO"

Description:
Hand Virtual Mouse is a Python-based project that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures and control the mouse pointer accordingly. The project employs the MediaPipe library for hand tracking, allowing users to manipulate the mouse pointer on the screen by moving their hand in front of a webcam.

Key Components:

1. MediaPipe Hands Module: The project leverages the MediaPipe Hands module, which provides robust hand tracking capabilities. This module enables the detection and tracking of multiple hand landmarks in real-time.

2. Video Capture: Hand Virtual Mouse utilizes OpenCV's video capture functionality to access frames from the webcam in real-time. These frames are then processed to detect hand gestures.

3. Hand Gesture Recognition: Once the frames are captured, the project analyzes them using the MediaPipe Hands module to identify hand landmarks and gestures. These gestures are interpreted to determine the movement of the mouse pointer.

4. Mouse Control: Based on the detected hand gestures, the project calculates the desired movement of the mouse pointer. This movement is then applied to control the actual mouse pointer on the screen.

5. Visualization: During runtime, the project visualizes the detected hand landmarks and gestures by overlaying them on the webcam feed. This provides users with real-time feedback on their hand movements.

Usage:

1. Run the Python script provided with the project.
2. Ensure that your webcam is correctly connected and accessible.
3. The webcam feed will display in a window titled "Hand Tracking".
4. Move your hand in front of the webcam to control the mouse pointer.
5. Hand gestures will be detected and translated into mouse movements in real-time.
6. Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

Dependencies:

Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe

Note: This project serves as a basic implementation of hand gesture-based mouse control and can be extended further to include additional functionalities such as gesture recognition for specific actions or gestures. Additionally, optimization and fine-tuning may be required for different lighting conditions and hand orientations.
